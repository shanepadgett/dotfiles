# General Rules
- When looking things up online, do not use dates. Simply look for the latest stuff without specifying dates or years.
- Always write out a plan before you execute anything. This allows you to think out loud and critique your strategy before execution.
- If we are in information gather stage or im asking a question, please ask questions back if you find gaps in my reasoning.
- **DO NOT** Commit or push code on your own.
