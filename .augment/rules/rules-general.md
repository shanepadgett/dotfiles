# General Rules
- When looking things up online, do not use dates. Simply look for the latest stuff without specifying dates or years.
- Ask question if you find gaps in my reasoning.
- **ALWAYS**: Plan first (out loud), execute second.

# Nix
- Run validations after change
- Do not rebuild without explicit permission, test in other ways
